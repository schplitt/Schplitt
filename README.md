# schplitt

My name is Jakob. I am a German software developer with a background in industrial automation and IIoT.

I am passionate about modern web development, with a particular interest in TypeScript, especially when the type system is pushed to its limits. My preferred stack is everything Vue and Nuxt related.

More from me on my [blog](https://schplitt.me/blog) (sometimes).
